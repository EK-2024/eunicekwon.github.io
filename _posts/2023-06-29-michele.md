## Michelle's paper is accepted for publication in Applied Surface Science. 
Michelle's work, titled "Theoretical assessments of CO<sub>2</sub> activation and hydrogenation pathways on transition-metal surfaces", is now published in Applied Surface Science. Congrats!

We just published three papers in one month! Great job, Lcats!
