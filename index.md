# Biography
Stephanie Kwon started her position as an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines in January 2020. Her research group focuses on understanding surface reactions at an atomic-level through combinative methods including kinetic, isotopic, spectroscopic, and theoretical methods. 

One of her recent work uncovered mechanistic details of re-oxidation steps of Mars-van Krevelen catalytic cycles by combining scavenging experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which evaluated free energies of intermediates and transition states involved in plausible reaction pathways that are indistinguishable from experiments. This approach, in turn, exposed unprecedented re-oxidation routes that are mediated by a molecular shuttle, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which kinetically couples two re-oxidation events occurring at distant locations. DFT calculations also identified the catalytic descriptors that determine the relative contributions of these H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> routes and the conventional routes that involve bound peroxo species.
