        The activation of dioxygen at typically isolated two-electron reduced centers can lead to the formation of electrophilic superoxo or peroxo species, providing an essential route to form reactive O<sub>2</sub>-derived species in biological, organometallic, and heterogeneous catalysts. Alternatively, O<sub>2</sub> activation can proceed via outer sphere routes, circumventing the formation of bound peroxo (OO<sup>*</sup>) species during oxidation catalysis by forming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(g), which can react with another reduced center to form H<sub>2</sub>O. The electronic and binding properties of metal oxides that determine the relative rates of these activation routes are assessed here by systematic theoretical treatments using density functional theory (DFT). These methods are combined with conceptual frameworks based on thermochemical cycles and crossing potential models to assess the most appropriate descriptors for the activation barriers for each route using Keggin polyoxometalates as illustrative examples. In doing so, we show that inner sphere routes, which form OO<sup>*</sup> species via O<sub>2</sub> activation on the O-vacancies (*) formed in the reduction part of redox cycles, are mediated by early transition states that only weakly sense the oxide binding properties. Outer sphere routes form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(g) via O<sub>2</sub> activation on OH pairs (H/OH<sup>*</sup>) formed by dissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O on O-vacancies; their rates and activation barriers reflect the rates of the first H-atom transfer from H/OH<sup>*</sup> to O<sub>2</sub>. The activation barriers for this H-transfer step depend on the binding energy of more weakly-bound H-atom in H/OH<sup>*</sup> pairs (HAE<sub>2</sub>) and on the <sup>.</sup>OOH-surface interaction energy at its product state (<em>E<sub>int</sub><sup>0</sup></em>). The <em>E<sub>int</sub><sup>0</sup></em> values are similar among oxides unless a large charge-balancing cation is present and interacts with <sup>.</sup>OOH; consequently, HAE<sub>2</sub> acts as an appropriate descriptor of the outer sphere dynamics. HAE<sub>2</sub> also determines the thermodynamics of H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation on O-vacancies, which influence the inner and outer sphere rates by setting the relative coverage of * and H/OH<sup>*</sup>. These results, in turn, show that HAE<sub>2</sub> is a complete descriptor of the reactivity and selectivity of oxides for O<sub>2</sub> activation; the O-atoms in more reducible oxides (more negative HAE<sub>2</sub>) exhibit a greater preference for the inner sphere routes and for the formation of electrophilic OO<sup>*</sup> intermediates that mediate epoxidation and O-insertion reactions during catalytic redox cycles. Large charge-balancing cations locally modify <em>E<sub>int</sub><sup>0</sup></em> values that determine the outer sphere rates and thus can be used to alter the preference of O-atoms to either inner or outer sphere routes.

        Catalytic redox cycles involve dioxygen activation via peroxo (OO<sup>∗</sup>) or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> species, denoted as inner-sphere and outer-sphere routes respectively, for metal-oxo catalysts solvated by liquids. On solid oxides, O<sub>2</sub> activation is typically more facile than the reduction part of redox cycles, making kinetic inquiries difficult at steady-state. These steps are examined here for oxidative alkanol dehydrogenation (ODH) by scavenging OO<sup>∗</sup> species with C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> to form epoxides and by energies and barriers from density functional theory. Alkanols react with O-atoms (O∗) in oxides to form vicinal OH pairs that eliminate H<sub>2</sub>O to form OO<sup>∗</sup> at O-vacancies formed or react with O<sub>2</sub> to give H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. OO<sup>∗</sup> reacts with alkanols to re-form O∗ via steps favored over OO<sup>∗</sup> migrations, otherwise required to oxidize non-vicinal vacancies. <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6 epoxidizes by reaction with OO<sup>∗</sup> with rates that increase with <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6 pressure, but reach constant values as all OO<sup>∗</sup> species react with <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6 at high <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6/alkanol ratios. Asymptotic epoxidation/ODH rate ratios are smaller than unity, because outer-sphere routes that shuttle O-atoms via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(g) are favored over endoergic vacancy formation required for inner-sphere routes. The relative contributions of these two routes are influenced by H<sub>2</sub>O, because vacancies, required to form OO<sup>∗</sup>, react with H<sub>2</sub>O to form OH pairs and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. OO<sup>∗</sup>-mediated routes and epoxidation become favored at low coverages of reduced centers, prevalent for less reactive alkanols and lower alkanol/O<sub>2</sub> ratios, because H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> then reacts preferentially with O∗ (forming OO<sup>∗</sup>), instead of vacancies (forming O∗/H<sub>2</sub>O). Such kinetic shunts between two routes compensate for lower barriers required to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than OO<sup>∗</sup>. These re-oxidation routes prefer molecular donor (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or acceptor (alkanol) to perform stepwise two-electron oxidations by dioxygen, instead of kinetically demanding O-atom migrations. The quantitative descriptions, derived from theory and experiment on Mo-based polyoxometalate clusters with known structures, bring together the dioxygen chemistry in liquid-phase oxidations, including electro-catalysis and monooxygenase enzymes, and oxide surfaces into a common framework, while suggesting a practical process for epoxidation by kinetically coupling with ODH reaction.

        Converting CO<sub>2</sub> into valuable C1 products such as CO, methanol, and methane using photocatalysts is an attractive way to recycle atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> into fine chemicals and fuels. The most commonly studied photocatalyst, TiO<sub>2</sub>, however, suffers from poor initial adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. To overcome this problem, it has been proposed that a thin overlayer of a basic oxide might promote CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and thus improve the reactivity of TiO<sub>2</sub> for photoreduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. In this work, we investigated CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption on the (100) surfaces of a series of basic, alkaline-earth metal oxides (MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO). Using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption becomes significantly more favorable in the order MgO < CaO < SrO < BaO, and we attribute this order to the more suitable lattice parameter of BaO compared to MgO. To understand the effect of a thin layer of basic oxide on TiO<sub>2</sub> for CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction, SrO on TiO<sub>2</sub> was investigated as a model system. A dramatic improvement in CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation was observed on SrO/TiO<sub>2</sub> compared to the bare TiO<sub>2</sub>, and dissociated water was found to be thermodynamically more favorable than intact water on the SrO/TiO<sub>2</sub> surface. A possible reaction route for the photocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO on the bare and SrO-modified TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces was further investigated. Although the reaction is slightly more favorable on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface than on the 0.5 ML SrO-covered TiO<sub>2</sub>, the SrO half layer helps activate CO<sub>2</sub> and favors desorption of CO, which are challenging steps for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction on pure TiO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, our results suggest that <1 ML SrO overlayer might be a promising candidate for further experimental exploration.

        A kinetic analysis of gas-phase cyclohexene epoxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> over mesoporous TS-1 was performed. The production of cyclohexene oxide was very stable with high selectivity. Based on the kinetic analysis, the gas-phase mechanism is proposed to be similar to that of the liquid-phase reaction: an Eley–Rideal type mechanism, in which the reaction between a Ti–OOH intermediate and the physisorbed alkene is the rate-determining step. When the partial pressure of water or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was varied, a compensation effect was observed. Based on the kinetic model, the compensation effect is attributed to variations in the surface coverage of intermediates, specifically the competitive adsorption of water and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at the Ti active sites. A meaningful activation energy can only be obtained at high surface coverages of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and was determined to be 40 ± 2 kJ/mol.

        The chiral Co(II) MOF [Co(<sub>L</sub>-RR)(H<sub>2</sub>O)·H<sub>2</sub>O]∞ [1; <sub>L</sub>-RR = (R,R)-thiazolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate] has been exploited in the catalytic oxidation of different alkenes (cyclohexene, (Z)-cyclooctene, 1-octene) using either tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) or molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as oxidants. Different chemoselectivities are observed, both substrate- and oxidant-dependent. A moderate enantioselectivity is also obtained in the case of prochiral precursors, revealing the chiral induction ability of the optically pure metal environment. The interaction of O<sub>2</sub> with the exposed metal sites in 1 (after material preactivation and consequent removal of the coordinated aquo ligand) has been studied through TPD-MS analysis combined with DFT calculations, with the aim of probing effective oxygen uptake by the heterogeneous catalyst and unraveling the nature of the active species in the catalytic oxidation process under aerobic conditions. Theoretical results indicate the presence of an η1-superoxo species at the cobalt center, with concomitant Co(II) ↔ Co(III) oxidation. Finally, the experimental estimation of the O<sub>2</sub> adsorption enthalpy is found to be in good agreement with the calculated binding energy.

        Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received attention for a myriad of potential applications including catalysis, gas storage, and gas separation. Coordinatively unsaturated metal ions often enable key functional behavior of these materials. Most commonly, MOFs have been metalated from the condensed phase (i.e., from solution). Here we introduce a new synthetic strategy capable of metallating MOFs from the gas phase: atomic layer deposition (ALD). Key to enabling metalation by ALD In MOFs (AIM) was the synthesis of NU-1000, a new, thermally stable, Zr-based MOF with spatially oriented −OH groups and large 1D mesopores and apertures.
