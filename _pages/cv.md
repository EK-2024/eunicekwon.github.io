### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Postdoctoral Fellow, University of California (UC), Berkeley (PI: Dr. Enrique Iglesia) 2015- • Uncovered mechanistic details of O2 activation routes in Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles by
 incorporating scavenging experiments with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.
• Identified descriptors of rates and selectivities of inner and outer sphere O2 activation pathways using theoretical assessments based on DFT calculations. (Manuscript in preparation for submission)
• Elucidated HCOOH decomposition elementary steps on TiO2 and Cu catalysts using combined efforts of kinetic, isotopic, spectroscopic, and temperature programmed surface reaction experiments and of DFT calculations on the energetics of intermediates and transition stations involved in the plausible reaction routes. Such results revealed unprecedented mono- and bi-molecular routes that
change with surface coverages. (Manuscripts in preparation for submission)
• Revealed the kinetics and elementary steps of gas-phase cyclohexene epoxidation with H2O2(g) on titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) catalysts by developing a flow reactor system that utilizes H2O2(g).
Ph.D. Student, Northwestern University (PIs: Drs. Randall Snurr and Peter Stair) 2010-2015
• Demonstrated propene oxidation with H2O2(g) to form acetone on Pd/Al2O3 and identified the reaction mechanisms via a detailed kinetic analysis, combined with DFT calculations
• Investigated the effects of basic oxide over-layers on TiO2 catalysts for CO2 adsorptions using DFT calculations and demonstrated the enhanced reactivities of MgO-decorated TiO2 for CO2 photo- reduction
• Identified O2 activation routes on the coordinatively unsaturated Co sites in Co-MOF using DFT calculations
• Improved the reactivity and stability of LaNiO3 perovskite catalysts for methane reforming reactions
Undergraduate Researcher, Seoul National University (PI: Dr. Sang-Heup Moon) 2009-2010
  
by supporting them into mesoporous silica. Further characterizations revealed the conversion of the perovskite structures into highly dispersed Ni on La2O3 during reactions.
