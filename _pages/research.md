Stephanie Kwon's primary research interest is to develop novel catalytic systems to solve environmental problems and to provide sustainable catalytic routes to produce desired products with minimal energy consumption and chemical waste.

 A molecular-level understanding of surface reactions is a prerequisite to achieving such goals, which requires the combinatory efforts of experiments and computational modeling. Her research incorporates kinetic, isotopic, and spectroscopic experiments with theoretical assessments and cutting-edge synthetic procedures, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques, to elucidate elementary steps involved in surface reactions and the catalytic properties that determine the reaction rates and selectivities.
